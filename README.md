# 💫 About Me:

 * Founder of [LecturaAI](https://lecturaai.com) : an all-in-one AI-powered study assistant
 * Building Telegram-based apps, student productivity tools, and mini-SaaS projects
 * Passionate about AI engineering, workflow automation, and full-stack development
 * Currently diving deeper into:
   - Computer Engineering fundamentals
   - AI pipelines & model integrations
   - DevOps (Render, Vercel, Google Cloud)
   - Ethical hacking & penetration testing
 * Fun fact: I build more apps than I publicly share — from offline AI extensions to automation tools. Shipping one polished product is harder than starting ten 😅
 * I’m a Christian who loves Jesus ❤️✝️ — and that purpose guides everything I create.
 * I’m most interested in real-world machine learning problems, especially applying Deep learning algorithms to solve problems many students face. I believe that we could able to create an algorithm to predict some funny questions like “What if Einstein was still alive with today’s technology? How far in science would we be? Would we have started time travel?”.

P.S If you want to talk about Quantum Neural Network or Energy efficient Deep learning Models, let me know.

  <summary><h3>👨‍💻 My Coding Journey</h3></summary>

I got into coding early through curiosity about hacking, electronics, and how things work.  
Before I had access to hardware like Arduino, I built DIY versions using recycled parts — which taught me problem-solving and resourcefulness.

I started programming with Python in high school, then moved into web development and graphics editing. Over time, that foundation evolved into a passion for building real products — from Telegram-based systems to AI-powered SaaS apps.

Today, as a Computer Engineering student, I’m focused on AI engineering, automation, and full-stack development. I’m constantly learning, experimenting, and building tools that solve real problems.
